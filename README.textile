h1. CliMod.js - CommonJS modules for browser (no compilation needed)

This is a simple JavaScript library that brings support of CommonJS modules to browser. You can simply @require()@ modules and they will be synchronously loaded, interpreted and exported.

h2. How does it work?

My library uses a synchronous XMLHttpRequest with interpretation by @eval()@ statement. This could be a little bit slower, but I think modern browsers are fast enough. In a next version there will be also a compiler that will store modules to JavaScript object, so they won't have to be loaded from file.

h2. Example

my-module.js

bc. module.exports = function(x, y){
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
};
module.exports.prototype.showCoords = function(){
  alert(this.x + " : " + this.y);
};


main.js

bc. var MyModule = require("my-module");
var obj = new MyModule(1, 5);
obj.showCoords(); //This will display "1 : 5"
